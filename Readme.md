## The Mission: 

The Ethiopian Merkato is a place for Portland's Ethiopian community to meet, embrace, and support each another in their rich, beautiful heritage. Covid has been especially hard on the Merkato and the community it supports. The objection of this site is to help potential customers learn about the Merkato Ethiopian, and preview what they can expect to find at the store.
